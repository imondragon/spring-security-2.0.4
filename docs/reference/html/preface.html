    <p>Spring Security provides a comprehensive security solution for
    J2EE-based enterprise software applications. As you will discover as you
    venture through this reference guide, we have tried to provide you a
    useful and highly configurable security system.</p>

    <p>Security is an ever-moving target, and it's important to pursue a
    comprehensive, system-wide approach. In security circles we encourage you
    to adopt "layers of security", so that each layer tries to be as secure as
    possible in its own right, with successive layers providing additional
    security. The "tighter" the security of each layer, the more robust and
    safe your application will be. At the bottom level you'll need to deal
    with issues such as transport security and system identification, in order
    to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks. Next you'll generally utilise
    firewalls, perhaps with VPNs or IP security to ensure only authorised
    systems can attempt to connect. In corporate environments you may deploy a
    DMZ to separate public-facing servers from backend database and
    application servers. Your operating system will also play a critical part,
    addressing issues such as running processes as non-privileged users and
    maximising file system security. An operating system will usually also be
    configured with its own firewall. Hopefully somewhere along the way you'll
    be trying to prevent denial of service and brute force attacks against the
    system. An intrusion detection system will also be especially useful for
    monitoring and responding to attacks, with such systems able to take
    protective action such as blocking offending TCP/IP addresses in
    real-time. Moving to the higher layers, your Java Virtual Machine will
    hopefully be configured to minimize the permissions granted to different
    Java types, and then your application will add its own problem
    domain-specific security configuration. Spring Security makes this latter
    area - application security - much easier. 
    </p>

    <p>Of course, you will need to properly address all security layers
    mentioned above, together with managerial factors that encompass every
    layer. A non-exhaustive list of such managerial factors would include
    security bulletin monitoring, patching, personnel vetting, audits, change
    control, engineering management systems, data backup, disaster recovery,
    performance benchmarking, load monitoring, centralised logging, incident
    response procedures etc.</p>

    <p>With Spring Security being focused on helping you with the
    enterprise application security layer, you will find that there are as
    many different requirements as there are business problem domains. A
    banking application has different needs from an ecommerce application. An
    ecommerce application has different needs from a corporate sales force
    automation tool. These custom requirements make application security
    interesting, challenging and rewarding.

    <p>Please read <a href="getting-started.html" title="Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Getting Started">Part&nbsp;I, &#8220;Getting Started&#8221;</a>, in
    its entirety to begin with. This will introduce you to the framework and the namespace-based
    configuration system with which you can get up and running quite quickly. To get more of an understanding
    of an in-depth understaning of how Spring Security works, and some of the classes you might
    need to use, you should then read <a href="overall-architecture.html" title="Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;Overall Architecture">Part&nbsp;II, &#8220;Overall Architecture&#8221;</a>.
    The remaining parts of this guide are structured in a more traditional reference style, 
    designed to be read on an as-required basis. We'd also recommend that you read up as much as 
    possible on application security issues in general. Spring Security is not a panacea which will
    solve all security issues. It is important that the application is designed with security in 
    mind from the start. Attempting to retrofit it is not a good idea. 
    In particular, if you are building a web application, you should be aware of the many potential
    vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, request-forgery and session-hijacking which you should
    be taking into account from the start. The OWASP web site (http://www.owasp.org/) maintains a
    top ten list of web application vulnerabilities as well as a lot of useful reference information.
