    <p>Spring Security is written to execute within a standard Java 1.4
    Runtime Environment. It also supports Java 5.0, although the Java
    types which are specific to this release are packaged in a separate
    package with the suffix "tiger" in their JAR filename. As Spring
    Security aims to operate in a self-contained manner, there is no need
    to place any special configuration files into your Java Runtime
    Environment. In particular, there is no need to configure a special
    Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) policy file or
    place Spring Security into common classpath locations.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if you are using an EJB Container or Servlet
    Container there is no need to put any special configuration files
    anywhere, nor include Spring Security in a server classloader.</p>

    <p>This design offers maximum deployment time flexibility, as
    you can simply copy your target artifact (be it a JAR, WAR or EAR)
    from one system to another and it will immediately work.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="shared-components"></a>5.2.&nbsp;Shared Components</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Let's explore some of the most important shared components in
    Spring Security. Components are considered "shared" if they are
    central to the framework and the framework cannot operate without
    them. These Java types represent the building blocks of the remaining
    system, so it's important to understand that they're there, even if
    you don't need to directly interact with them.</p>


    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e593"></a>5.2.1.&nbsp;
        SecurityContextHolder, SecurityContext and Authentication Objects
      </h3></div></div></div>
      
    <p>The most fundamental object is
    <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>. This is where we store
    details of the present security context of the application, which
    includes details of the principal currently using the application. By
    default the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code> uses a
    <code class="literal">ThreadLocal</code> to store these details, which means
    that the security context is always available to methods in the same
    thread of execution, even if the security context is not explicitly
    passed around as an argument to those methods. Using a
    <code class="literal">ThreadLocal</code> in this way is quite safe if care is
    taken to clear the thread after the present principal's request is
    processed. Of course, Spring Security takes care of this for you
    automatically so there is no need to worry about it.</p>

    <p>Some applications aren't entirely suitable for using a
    <code class="literal">ThreadLocal</code>, because of the specific way they work
    with threads. For example, a Swing client might want all threads in a
    Java Virtual Machine to use the same security context. For this
    situation you would use the
    <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder.MODE_GLOBAL</code>. Other
    applications might want to have threads spawned by the secure thread
    also assume the same security identity. This is achieved by using
    <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder.MODE_INHERITABLETHREADLOCAL</code>.
    You can change the mode from the default
    <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder.MODE_THREADLOCAL</code> in two ways.
    The first is to set a system property. Alternatively, call a static
    method on <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>. Most applications
    won't need to change from the default, but if you do, take a look at
    the JavaDocs for <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code> to learn
    more.</p>

    <p>Inside the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code> we store
    details of the principal currently interacting with the application.
    Spring Security uses an <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object to
    represent this information. Whilst you won't normally need to create
    an <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object yourself, it is fairly
    common for users to query the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>
    object. You can use the following code block - from anywhere in your
    application - to obtain the name of the authenticated user, for example:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">
Object obj = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();

if (obj instanceof UserDetails) {
  String username = ((UserDetails)obj).getUsername();
} else {
  String username = obj.toString();
}</pre>

    <p>The above code introduces a number of interesting relationships
    and key objects. First, you will notice that there is an intermediate
    object between <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code> and
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>. The
    <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder.getContext()</code> method is
    actually returning a <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code>. 
      
      
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e618"></a>5.2.2.&nbsp;The UserDetailsService</h3></div></div></div>
      

    <p>Another item to note from the above code fragment is that you
    can obtain a principal from the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>
    object. The principal is just an <code class="literal">Object</code>. Most of
    the time this can be cast into a <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code>
    object. <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> is a central interface in
    Spring Security. It represents a principal, but in an extensible and
    application-specific way. Think of <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> as
    the adapter between your own user database and what Spring Security
    needs inside the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>. Being a
    representation of something from your own user database, quite often
    you will cast the <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> to the original
    object that your application provided, so you can call
    business-specific methods (like <code class="literal">getEmail()</code>,
    <code class="literal">getEmployeeNumber()</code> and so on).</p>

    <p>By now you're probably wondering, so when do I provide a
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> object? How do I do that? I thought you
    said this thing was declarative and I didn't need to write any Java
    code - what gives? The short answer is that there is a special
    interface called <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>. The only
    method on this interface accepts a <code class="literal">String</code>-based
    username argument and returns a <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code>. Most
    authentication providers that ship with Spring Security delegate to a
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code> as part of the authentication
    process. The <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code> is used to build
    the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object that is stored in the
    <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>. The good news is that we
    provide a number of <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>
    implementations, including one that uses an in-memory map and another
    that uses JDBC. Most users tend to write their own, though, with such
    implementations often simply sitting on top of an existing Data Access
    Object (DAO) that represents their employees, customers, or other
    users of the enterprise application. Remember the advantage that
    whatever your UserDetailsService returns can always be obtained from
    the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>, as per the above code
    fragment.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tech-granted-authority"></a>5.2.3.&nbsp;GrantedAuthority</h3></div></div></div>
      

    <p>Besides the principal, another important method provided by
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> is
    <code class="literal">getAuthorities(</code>). This method provides an array of
    <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code> objects. A
    <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code> is, not surprisingly, an authority
    that is granted to the principal. Such authorities are usually
    "roles", such as <code class="literal">ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR</code> or
    <code class="literal">ROLE_HR_SUPERVISOR</code>. These roles are later on
    configured for web authorization, method authorization and domain
    object authorization. Other parts of Spring Security are capable of
    interpreting these authorities, and expect them to be present.
    <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code> objects are usually loaded by the
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>.</p>

    <p>Usually the <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code> objects are
    application-wide permissions. They are not specific to a given domain
    object. Thus, you wouldn't likely have a
    <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code> to represent a permission to
    <code class="literal">Employee</code> object number 54, because if there are
    thousands of such authorities you would quickly run out of memory (or,
    at the very least, cause the application to take a long time to
    authenticate a user). Of course, Spring Security is expressly designed
    to handle this common requirement, but you'd instead use the project's
    domain object security capabilities for this purpose.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, sometimes you will need to store the
    <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code> between HTTP requests. Other times
    the principal will re-authenticate on every request, although most of
    the time it will be stored. The
    <code class="classname">HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter</code> is responsible
    for storing a <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code> between HTTP
    requests. As suggested by the name of the class, the
    <code class="literal">HttpSession</code> is used to store this information. You
    should never interact directly with the <code class="literal">HttpSession</code>
    for security purposes. There is simply no justification for doing so -
    always use the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>
    instead.</p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e663"></a>5.2.4.&nbsp;Summary</h3></div></div></div>
      
    <p>Just to recap, the major building blocks of Spring Security
    are:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li>
        <p><code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>, to provide any
        type access to the <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code>.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code>, to hold the
        <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> and possibly request-specific
        security information.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="classname">HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter</code>, to
        store the <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code> in the
        <code class="literal">HttpSession</code> between web requests.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>, to represent the
        principal in a Spring Security-specific manner.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code>, to reflect the
        application-wide permissions granted to a principal.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code>, to provide the necessary
        information to build an Authentication object from your
        application's DAOs.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>, to create a
        <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> when passed in a
        <code class="literal">String</code>-based username (or certificate ID or
        alike).</p>
      </li></ul></div>

    <p>Now that you've gained an understanding of these repeatedly-used
    components, let's take a closer look at the process of
    authentication.</p>
      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="common-authentication"></a>5.3.&nbsp;Authentication</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>As mentioned in the beginning of this reference guide, Spring
    Security can participate in many different authentication
    environments. Whilst we recommend people use Spring Security for
    authentication and not integrate with existing Container Managed
    Authentication, it is nevertheless supported - as is integrating with
    your own proprietary authentication system. Let's first explore
    authentication from the perspective of Spring Security managing web
    security entirely on its own, which is illustrative of the most
    complex and most common situation.</p>

    <p>Consider a typical web application's authentication
    process:</p>

    <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>
        <p>You visit the home page, and click on a link.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>A request goes to the server, and the server decides that
        you've asked for a protected resource.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>As you're not presently authenticated, the server sends back
        a response indicating that you must authenticate. The response
        will either be an HTTP response code, or a redirect to a
        particular web page.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Depending on the authentication mechanism, your browser will
        either redirect to the specific web page so that you can fill out
        the form, or the browser will somehow retrieve your identity (eg a
        BASIC authentication dialogue box, a cookie, a X509 certificate
        etc).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>The browser will send back a response to the server. This
        will either be an HTTP POST containing the contents of the form
        that you filled out, or an HTTP header containing your
        authentication details.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Next the server will decide whether or not the presented
        credentials are valid. If they're valid, the next step will
        happen. If they're invalid, usually your browser will be asked to
        try again (so you return to step two above).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>The original request that you made to cause the
        authentication process will be retried. Hopefully you've
        authenticated with sufficient granted authorities to access the
        protected resource. If you have sufficient access, the request
        will be successful. Otherwise, you'll receive back an HTTP error
        code 403, which means "forbidden".</p>
      </li></ol></div>

    <p>Spring Security has distinct classes responsible for most of the
    steps described above. The main participants (in the order that they
    are used) are the <code class="classname">ExceptionTranslationFilter</code>, an
    <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationEntryPoint</code>, an authentication
    mechanism, and an <code class="classname">AuthenticationProvider</code>.</p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e720"></a>5.3.1.&nbsp;ExceptionTranslationFilter</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p><code class="classname">ExceptionTranslationFilter</code> is a Spring
        Security filter that has responsibility for detecting any Spring
        Security exceptions that are thrown. Such exceptions will generally be
        thrown by an <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code>, which is
        the main provider of authorization services. We will discuss
        <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> in the next section,
        but for now we just need to know that it produces Java exceptions and
        knows nothing about HTTP or how to go about authenticating a
        principal. Instead the <code class="classname">ExceptionTranslationFilter</code>
        offers this service, with specific responsibility for either returning
        error code 403 (if the principal has been authenticated and therefore
        simply lacks sufficient access - as per step seven above), or
        launching an <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationEntryPoint</code> (if the
        principal has not been authenticated and therefore we need to go
        commence step three).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tech-auth-entry-point"></a>5.3.2.&nbsp;AuthenticationEntryPoint</h3></div></div></div>
      
    <p>The <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationEntryPoint</code> is responsible
    for step three in the above list. As you can imagine, each web
    application will have a default authentication strategy (well, this
    can be configured like nearly everything else in Spring Security, but
    let's keep it simple for now). Each major authentication system will
    have its own <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationEntryPoint</code>
    implementation, which takes actions such as described in step
    three.</p>

    <p>After your browser decides to submit your authentication
    credentials (either as an HTTP form post or HTTP header) there needs
    to be something on the server that "collects" these authentication
    details. By now we're at step six in the above list. In Spring
    Security we have a special name for the function of collecting
    authentication details from a user agent (usually a web browser), and
    that name is "authentication mechanism". After the authentication
    details are collected from the user agent, an
    "<code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> request" object is built and then
    presented to an
    <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationProvider</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e736"></a>5.3.3.&nbsp;AuthenticationProvider</h3></div></div></div>
      
    <p>The last player in the Spring Security authentication process is
    an <code class="classname">AuthenticationProvider</code>. Quite simply, it is
    responsible for taking an <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> request
    object and deciding whether or not it is valid. The provider will
    either throw an exception or return a fully populated
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object. Remember our good friends,
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> and
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>? If not, head back to the
    previous section and refresh your memory. Most
    <code class="classname">AuthenticationProvider</code>s will ask a
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code> to provide a
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> object. As mentioned earlier, most
    application will provide their own
    <code class="interfacename">UserDetailsService</code>, although some will be able to
    use the JDBC or in-memory implementation that ships with Spring
    Security. The resultant <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> object - and
    particularly the <code class="literal">GrantedAuthority[]</code>s contained
    within the <code class="interfacename">UserDetails</code> object - will be used when
    building the fully populated <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>
    object.</p>
    <p>After the authentication mechanism receives back the
      fully-populated <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object, it will deem
      the request valid, put the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> into the
      <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>, and cause the original
      request to be retried (step seven above). If, on the other hand, the
      <code class="classname">AuthenticationProvider</code> rejected the request, the
      authentication mechanism will ask the user agent to retry (step two
      above).</p>
      
    </div>
    
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e757"></a>5.3.4.&nbsp;Setting the SecurityContextHolder Contents Directly</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Whilst this describes the typical authentication workflow, the
      good news is that Spring Security doesn't mind how you put an
      <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> inside the
      <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>. The only critical
      requirement is that the <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code>
      contains an <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> that represents a
      principal before the <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code>
      needs to authorize a request.</p>
  
      <p>You can (and many users do) write their own filters or MVC
      controllers to provide interoperability with authentication systems
      that are not based on Spring Security. For example, you might be using
      Container-Managed Authentication which makes the current user
      available from a ThreadLocal or JNDI location. Or you might work for a
      company that has a legacy proprietary authentication system, which is
      a corporate "standard" over which you have little control. In such
      situations it's quite easy to get Spring Security to work, and still
      provide authorization capabilities. All you need to do is write a
      filter (or equivalent) that reads the third-party user information
      from a location, build a Spring Security-specific Authentication
      object, and put it onto the SecurityContextHolder. It's quite easy to
      do this, and it is a fully-supported integration approach.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="secure-objects"></a>5.4.&nbsp;Secure Objects</h2></div></div></div>
    
    
    <p>Spring Security uses the term "secure object" to refer to any
    object that can have security (such as an authorization decision) applied to it. 
    The most common examples are method invocations and web requests. 
    </p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e771"></a>5.4.1.&nbsp;Security and AOP Advice</h3></div></div></div>
      
    <p>If you're familiar with AOP, you'd be aware there are different
    types of advice available: before, after, throws and around. An around
    advice is very useful, because an advisor can elect whether or not to
    proceed with a method invocation, whether or not to modify the
    response, and whether or not to throw an exception. Spring Security
    provides an around advice for method invocations as well as web
    requests. We achieve an around advice for method invocations using Spring's 
    standard AOP support and we achieve an around advice for web requests using a
    standard Filter.</p>

    <p>For those not familiar with AOP, the key point to understand is
    that Spring Security can help you protect method invocations as well
    as web requests. Most people are interested in securing method
    invocations on their services layer. This is because the services
    layer is where most business logic resides in current-generation J2EE
    applications (for clarification, the author disapproves of this design
    and instead advocates properly encapsulated domain objects together
    with the DTO, assembly, facade and transparent persistence patterns,
    but as use of anemic domain objects is the present mainstream approach, we'll
    talk about it here). If you just need to secure method invocations to
    the services layer, Spring's standard AOP (otherwise known as AOP Alliance) 
    will be adequate. If you need to secure domain objects directly, you 
    will likely find that AspectJ is worth considering.</p>

    <p>You can elect to perform method authorization using AspectJ or
    Spring AOP, or you can elect to perform web request authorization
    using filters. You can use zero, one, two or three of these approaches
    together. The mainstream usage is to perform some web request
    authorization, coupled with some Spring AOP method invocation
    authorization on the services layer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e776"></a>5.4.2.&nbsp;AbstractSecurityInterceptor</h3></div></div></div>
      

    <p>Each secure object type supported by Spring Security has its own class, 
      which is a subclass of <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code>.
      Importantly, by the time the <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> is called, the
    <code class="classname">SecurityContextHolder</code> will contain a valid
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> if the principal has been
    authenticated.</p>

    <p><code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> provides a
    consistent workflow for handling secure object requests, typically:
    
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Look up the "configuration attributes" associated with the
      present request</p></li><li><p>Submitting the secure object, current <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>

      <p>
        A "configuration attribute" can be thought of as a String that has special meaning to the classes used by
        <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code>. They may be simple role names or have more complex meaning, depending on the
        how sophisticated the <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionManager</code> implementation is. 
        The <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> is configured with an <code class="interfacename">ObjectDefinitionSource</code> which 
        it uses to look up the attributes for a secure object. Usually this configuration will be hidden from the user. Configuration
        attributes will be entered as annotations on secured methods, or as access attributes on secured URLs (using the 
        namespace <code class="literal">&lt;intercept-url&gt;</code> syntax).

    <p>Assuming <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionManager</code> decides to
    allow the request, the <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code>
    will normally just proceed with the request. Having said that, on rare
    occasions users may want to replace the
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> inside the
    <code class="interfacename">SecurityContext</code> with a different
    <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>, which is handled by the
    <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionManager</code> calling a
    <code class="literal">RunAsManager</code>. This might be useful in reasonably
    unusual situations, such as if a services layer method needs to call a
    remote system and present a different identity. Because Spring
    Security automatically propagates security identity from one server to
    another (assuming you're using a properly-configured RMI or
    HttpInvoker remoting protocol client), this may be useful.</p>

    <p>Following the secure object proceeding and then returning -
    which may mean a method invocation completing or a filter chain
    proceeding - the <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> gets
    one final chance to handle the invocation. At this stage the
    <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> is interested in
    possibly modifying the return object. We might want this to happen
    because an authorization decision couldn't be made "on the way in" to
    a secure object invocation. Being highly pluggable,
    <code class="classname">AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> will pass control to an
    <code class="literal">AfterInvocationManager</code> to actually modify the
      object if needed. This class can even entirely replace the object, or
    throw an exception, or not change it in any way.</p>

    <p>Only developers contemplating an entirely new way of
    intercepting and authorizing requests would need to use secure objects
    directly. For example, it would be possible to build a new secure
    object to secure calls to a messaging system. Anything that requires
    security and also provides a way of intercepting a call (like the AOP
    around advice semantics) is capable of being made into a secure
    object. Having said that, most Spring applications will simply use the
    three currently supported secure object types (AOP Alliance
    <code class="classname">MethodInvocation</code>, AspectJ
    <code class="literal">JoinPoint</code> and web request
    <code class="classname">FilterInvocation</code>) with complete
    transparency.</p>
