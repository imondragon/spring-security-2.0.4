    <p>Spring Security provides comprehensive security services for
        J2EE-based enterprise software applications. There is a particular
        emphasis on supporting projects built using The Spring Framework,
        which is the leading J2EE solution for enterprise software
        development. If you're not using Spring for developing enterprise
        applications, we warmly encourage you to take a closer look at it.
        Some familiarity with Spring - and in particular dependency injection
        principles - will help you get up to speed with Spring Security more
        easily.</p>
    
    <p>People use Spring Security for many reasons, but most are drawn
        to the project after finding the security features of J2EE's Servlet
        Specification or EJB Specification lack the depth required for typical
        enterprise application scenarios. Whilst mentioning these standards,
        it's important to recognise that they are not portable at a WAR or EAR
        level. Therefore, if you switch server environments, it is typically a
        lot of work to reconfigure your application's security in the new
        target environment. Using Spring Security overcomes these problems,
        and also brings you dozens of other useful, entirely customisable
        security features.</p>
    
    <p>As you probably know, security comprises two major operations.
        The first is known as "authentication", which is the process of
        establishing a principal is who they claim to be. A "principal"
        generally means a user, device or some other system which can perform
        an action in your application. "Authorization" refers to the process
        of deciding whether a principal is allowed to perform an action in
        your application. To arrive at the point where an authorization
        decision is needed, the identity of the principal has already been
        established by the authentication process. These concepts are common,
        and not at all specific to Spring Security.</p>
    
    <p>At an authentication level, Spring Security supports a wide
        range of authentication models. Most of these authentication models
        are either provided by third parties, or are developed by relevant
        standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force. In
        addition, Spring Security provides its own set of authentication
        features. Specifically, Spring Security currently supports
        authentication integration with all of these technologies:</p>

    <p>Many independent software vendors (ISVs) adopt Spring Security
        because of this significant choice of flexible authentication models.
        Doing so allows them to quickly integrate their solutions with
        whatever their end clients need, without undertaking a lot of
        engineering or requiring the client to change their environment. If
        none of the above authentication mechanisms suit your needs, Spring
        Security is an open platform and it is quite simple to write your own
        authentication mechanism. Many corporate users of Spring Security need
        to integrate with "legacy" systems that don't follow any particular
        security standards, and Spring Security is happy to "play nicely" with
        such systems.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes the mere process of authentication isn't enough.
        Sometimes you need to also differentiate security based on the way a
        principal is interacting with your application. For example, you might
        want to ensure requests only arrive over HTTPS, in order to protect
        passwords from eavesdropping or end users from man-in-the-middle
        attacks. Or, you might want to ensure that an actual human being is
        making the requests and not some robot or other automated process.
        This is especially helpful to protect password recovery processes from
        brute force attacks, or simply to make it harder for people to
        duplicate your application's key content. To help you achieve these
        goals, Spring Security fully supports automatic "channel security",
        together with JCaptcha integration for human user detection.</p>
    
    <p>Irrespective of how authentication was undertaken, Spring
        Security provides a deep set of authorization capabilities. There are
        three main areas of interest in respect of authorization, these being
        authorizing web requests, authorizing methods can be invoked, and
        authorizing access to individual domain object instances. To help you
        understand the differences, consider the authorization capabilities
        found in the Servlet Specification web pattern security, EJB Container
        Managed Security and file system security respectively. Spring
        Security provides deep capabilities in all of these important areas,
        which we'll explore later in this reference guide.</p>

<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="history"></a>1.2.&nbsp;History</h2></div></div></div>
    
    
    <p>Spring Security began in late 2003 as "The Acegi Security System
        for Spring". A question was posed on the Spring Developers' mailing
        list asking whether there had been any consideration given to a
        Spring-based security implementation. At the time the Spring community
        was relatively small (especially by today's size!), and indeed Spring
        itself had only existed as a SourceForge project from early 2003. The
        response to the question was that it was a worthwhile area, although a
        lack of time currently prevented its exploration.</p>
    
    <p>With that in mind, a simple security implementation was built
        and not released. A few weeks later another member of the Spring
        community inquired about security, and at the time this code was
        offered to them. Several other requests followed, and by January 2004
        around twenty people were using the code. These pioneering users were
        joined by others who suggested a SourceForge project was in order,
        which was duly established in March 2004.</p>
    
    <p>In those early days, the project didn't have any of its own
        authentication modules. Container Managed Security was relied upon for
        the authentication process, with Acegi Security instead focusing on
        authorization. This was suitable at first, but as more and more users
        requested additional container support, the fundamental limitation of
        container-specific authentication realm interfaces was experienced.
        There was also a related issue of adding new JARs to the container's
        classpath, which was a common source of end user confusion and
        misconfiguration.</p>
    
    <p>Acegi Security-specific authentication services were
        subsequently introduced. Around a year later, Acegi Security became an
        official Spring Framework subproject. The 1.0.0 final release was
        published in May 2006 - after more than two and a half years of active
        use in numerous production software projects and many hundreds of
        improvements and community contributions.</p>
    
    <p>Acegi Security became an official Spring Portfolio project 
        towards the end of 2007 and was rebranded as "Spring Security".</p>
    
    <p>Today Spring Security enjoys a strong and active open source
        community. There are thousands of messages about Spring Security on
        the support forums. There is an active core of developers work 
        who work on the code itself and an active community which also 
        regularly share patches and support their peers.</p>

<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="release-numbering"></a>1.3.&nbsp;Release Numbering</h2></div></div></div>
    
    
    <p>It is useful to understand how Spring Security release numbers
        work, as it will help you identify the effort (or lack thereof)
        involved in migrating to future releases of the project. Officially,
        we use the Apache Portable Runtime Project versioning guidelines,
        which can be viewed at
        <code class="literal">http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html</code>. We quote the
        introduction contained on that page for your convenience:</p>
    
    <p>&#8220;<span class="quote">Versions are denoted using a standard triplet of
        integers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The basic intent is that MAJOR versions
        are incompatible, large-scale upgrades of the API. MINOR versions
        retain source and binary compatibility with older minor versions, and
        changes in the PATCH level are perfectly compatible, forwards and
        backwards.</span>&#8221;</p>

<div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="get-source"></a>1.4.&nbsp;Getting the Source</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
        Since Spring Security is an Open Source project, we'd strongly encourage you to 
        check out the source code using subversion. This will give you full access to all the sample
        applications and you can build the most up to date version of the project easily.
        Having the source for a project is also a huge help in debugging. Exception stack traces are no 
        longer obscure black-box issues but you can get straight to the line that's causing the problem
        and work out what's happening. The source is the ultimate documentation for a project and often 
        the simplest place to find out how something actually works.
    </p>
    <p>
        To obtain the source for the project trunk, use the following subversion command:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    svn checkout http://acegisecurity.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/acegisecurity/spring-security/trunk/
</pre><p>
        You can checkout specific versions from <code class="literal">http://acegisecurity.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/acegisecurity/spring-security/tags/</code>.
