        <p>PLEASE NOTE: Before release 2.0.0, Spring Security was known as Acegi Security. An ACL
            module was provided with the old Acegi Security releases under the
                <code class="literal">org.[acegisecurity/springsecurity].acl</code> package. This old package
            is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Spring Security. This
            chapter covers the new ACL module, which is officially recommended from Spring Security
            2.0.0 and above, and can be found under the
            <code class="literal">org.springframework.security.acls</code> package.</p>
        <p>Complex applications often will find the need to define access permissions not simply
            at a web request or method invocation level. Instead, security decisions need to
            comprise both who (<code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>), where
            (<code class="classname">MethodInvocation</code>) and what (<code class="literal">SomeDomainObject</code>). In
            other words, authorization decisions also need to consider the actual domain object
            instance subject of a method invocation.</p>
        <p>Imagine you're designing an application for a pet clinic. There will be two main
            groups of users of your Spring-based application: staff of the pet clinic, as well as
            the pet clinic's customers. The staff will have access to all of the data, whilst your
            customers will only be able to see their own customer records. To make it a little more
            interesting, your customers can allow other users to see their customer records, such as
            their "puppy preschool" mentor or president of their local "Pony Club". Using Spring
            Security as the foundation, you have several approaches that can be used:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>
                    <p>Write your business methods to enforce the security. You could consult a
                        collection within the <code class="literal">Customer</code> domain object instance to
                        determine which users have access. By using the
                            <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()</code>,
                        you'll be able to access the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>
                    object.</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>Write an <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionVoter</code> to enforce the security
                        from the <code class="literal">GrantedAuthority[]</code>s stored in the
                            <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object. This would mean your
                            <code class="interfacename">AuthenticationManager</code> would need to populate the
                            <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> with custom
                        <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code>[]s representing each of the
                            <code class="literal">Customer</code> domain object instances the principal has
                        access to.</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>Write an <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionVoter</code> to enforce the security
                        and open the target <code class="literal">Customer</code> domain object directly. This
                        would mean your voter needs access to a DAO that allows it to retrieve the
                            <code class="literal">Customer</code> object. It would then access the
                            <code class="literal">Customer</code> object's collection of approved users and
                        make the appropriate decision.</p>
                </li></ol></div>
        <p>Each one of these approaches is perfectly legitimate. However, the first couples your
            authorization checking to your business code. The main problems with this include the
            enhanced difficulty of unit testing and the fact it would be more difficult to reuse the
                <code class="literal">Customer</code> authorization logic elsewhere. Obtaining the
                <code class="literal">GrantedAuthority[]</code>s from the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code>
            object is also fine, but will not scale to large numbers of
            <code class="literal">Customer</code>s. If a user might be able to access 5,000
            <code class="literal">Customer</code>s (unlikely in this case, but imagine if it were a popular
            vet for a large Pony Club!) the amount of memory consumed and time required to construct
            the <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object would be undesirable. The final method,
            opening the <code class="literal">Customer</code> directly from external code, is probably the
            best of the three. It achieves separation of concerns, and doesn't misuse memory or CPU
            cycles, but it is still inefficient in that both the
            <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionVoter</code> and the eventual business method itself will
            perform a call to the DAO responsible for retrieving the <code class="literal">Customer</code>
            object. Two accesses per method invocation is clearly undesirable. In addition, with
            every approach listed you'll need to write your own access control list (ACL)
            persistence and business logic from scratch.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is another alternative, which we'll talk about below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="domain-acls-key-concepts"></a>24.2.&nbsp;Key Concepts</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Spring Security's ACL services are shipped in the
            <code class="literal">spring-security-acl-xxx.jar</code>. You will need to add this JAR to your
            classpath to use Spring Security's domain object instance security capabilities.</p>
        <p>Spring Security's domain object instance security capabilities centre on the concept
            of an access control list (ACL). Every domain object instance in your system has its own
            ACL, and the ACL records details of who can and can't work with that domain object. With
            this in mind, Spring Security delivers three main ACL-related capabilities to your application:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
                    <p>A way of efficiently retrieving ACL entries for all of your domain objects
                        (and modifying those ACLs)</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>A way of ensuring a given principal is permitted to work with your
                        objects, before methods are called</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>A way of ensuring a given principal is permitted to work with your objects
                        (or something they return), after methods are called</p>
                </li></ul></div>
        <p>As indicated by the first bullet point, one of the main capabilities of the Spring
            Security ACL module is providing a high-performance way of retrieving ACLs. This ACL
            repository capability is extremely important, because every domain object instance in
            your system might have several access control entries, and each ACL might inherit from
            other ACLs in a tree-like structure (this is supported out-of-the-box by Spring
            Security, and is very commonly used). Spring Security's ACL capability has been
            carefully designed to provide high performance retrieval of ACLs, together with
            pluggable caching, deadlock-minimizing database updates, independence from ORM
            frameworks (we use JDBC directly), proper encapsulation, and transparent database
            updating.</p>
        <p>Given databases are central to the operation of the ACL module, let's explore the four
            main tables used by default in the implementation. The tables are presented below in
            order of size in a typical Spring Security ACL deployment, with the table with the most
            rows listed last:</p>
        <p>
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
                    <p>ACL_SID allows us to uniquely identify any principal or authority in the
                        system ("SID" stands for "security identity"). The only columns are the ID,
                        a textual representation of the SID, and a flag to indicate whether the
                        textual representation refers to a prncipal name or a
                            <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code>. Thus, there is a single row for
                        each unique principal or <code class="interfacename">GrantedAuthority</code>. When used in
                        the context of receiving a permission, a SID is generally called a
                        "recipient".</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>ACL_CLASS allows us to uniquely identify any domain object class in the
                        system. The only columns are the ID and the Java class name. Thus, there is
                        a single row for each unique Class we wish to store ACL permissions
                    for.</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>ACL_OBJECT_IDENTITY stores information for each unique domain object
                        instance in the system. Columns include the ID, a foreign key to the
                        ACL_CLASS table, a unique identifier so we know which ACL_CLASS instance
                        we're providing information for, the parent, a foreign key to the ACL_SID
                        table to represent the owner of the domain object instance, and whether we
                        allow ACL entries to inherit from any parent ACL. We have a single row for
                        every domain object instance we're storing ACL permissions for.</p>
                </li><li>
                    <p>Finally, ACL_ENTRY stores the individual permissions assigned to each
                        recipient. Columns include a foreign key to the ACL_OBJECT_IDENTITY, the
                        recipient (ie a foreign key to ACL_SID), whether we'll be auditing or not,
                        and the integer bit mask that represents the actual permission being granted
                        or denied. We have a single row for every recipient that receives a
                        permission to work with a domain object.</p>
                </li></ul></div><p>
        </p>
        <p>As mentioned in the last paragraph, the ACL system uses integer bit masking. Don't
            worry, you need not be aware of the finer points of bit shifting to use the ACL system,
            but suffice to say that we have 32 bits we can switch on or off. Each of these bits
            represents a permission, and by default the permissions are read (bit 0), write (bit 1),
            create (bit 2), delete (bit 3) and administer (bit 4). It's easy to implement your own
                <code class="literal">Permission</code> instance if you wish to use other permissions, and the
            remainder of the ACL framework will operate without knowledge of your extensions.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that the number of domain objects in your system has
            absolutely no bearing on the fact we've chosen to use integer bit masking. Whilst you
            have 32 bits available for permissions, you could have billions of domain object
            instances (which will mean billions of rows in ACL_OBJECT_IDENTITY and quite probably
            ACL_ENTRY). We make this point because we've found sometimes people mistakenly believe
            they need a bit for each potential domain object, which is not the case.</p>
        <p>Now that we've provided a basic overview of what the ACL system does, and what it
            looks like at a table structure, let's explore the key interfaces. The key interfaces
            are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li>
                <p><code class="literal">Acl</code>: Every domain object has one and only one
                    <code class="literal">Acl</code> object, which internally holds the
                        <code class="literal">AccessControlEntry</code>s as well as knows the owner of the
                        <code class="literal">Acl</code>. An Acl does not refer directly to the domain object,
                    but instead to an <code class="literal">ObjectIdentity</code>. The <code class="literal">Acl</code>
                    is stored in the ACL_OBJECT_IDENTITY table.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">AccessControlEntry</code>: An <code class="literal">Acl</code> holds
                    multiple <code class="literal">AccessControlEntry</code>s, which are often abbreviated as
                    ACEs in the framework. Each ACE refers to a specific tuple of
                        <code class="literal">Permission</code>, <code class="literal">Sid</code> and
                    <code class="literal">Acl</code>. An ACE can also be granting or non-granting and contain
                    audit settings. The ACE is stored in the ACL_ENTRY table.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">Permission</code>: A permission represents a particular immutable
                    bit mask, and offers convenience functions for bit masking and outputting
                    information. The basic permissions presented above (bits 0 through 4) are
                    contained in the <code class="literal">BasePermission</code> class.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">Sid</code>: The ACL module needs to refer to principals and
                        <code class="literal">GrantedAuthority[]</code>s. A level of indirection is provided
                    by the <code class="literal">Sid</code> interface, which is an abbreviation of "security
                    identity". Common classes include <code class="literal">PrincipalSid</code> (to represent
                    the principal inside an <code class="interfacename">Authentication</code> object) and
                        <code class="literal">GrantedAuthoritySid</code>. The security identity information is
                    stored in the ACL_SID table.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">ObjectIdentity</code>: Each domain object is represented
                    internally within the ACL module by an <code class="literal">ObjectIdentity</code>. The
                    default implementation is called <code class="literal">ObjectIdentityImpl</code>.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">AclService</code>: Retrieves the <code class="literal">Acl</code> applicable
                    for a given <code class="literal">ObjectIdentity</code>. In the included implementation
                        (<code class="literal">JdbcAclService</code>), retrieval operations are delegated to a
                        <code class="literal">LookupStrategy</code>. The <code class="literal">LookupStrategy</code>
                    provides a highly optimized strategy for retrieving ACL information, using
                    batched retrievals <code class="literal">(BasicLookupStrategy</code>) and supporting
                    custom implementations that leverage materialized views, hierarchical queries
                    and similar performance-centric, non-ANSI SQL capabilities.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><code class="literal">MutableAclService</code>: Allows a modified <code class="literal">Acl</code>
                    to be presented for persistence. It is not essential to use this interface if
                    you do not wish.</p>
            </li></ul></div>
        <p>Please note that our out-of-the-box AclService and related database classes all use
            ANSI SQL. This should therefore work with all major databases. At the time of writing,
            the system had been successfully tested using Hypersonic SQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL
            Server and Oracle.</p>
        <p>Two samples ship with Spring Security that demonstrate the ACL module. The first is
            the Contacts Sample, and the other is the Document Management System (DMS) Sample. We
            suggest taking a look over these for examples.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="domain-acls-getting-started"></a>24.3.&nbsp;Getting Started</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>To get starting using Spring Security's ACL capability, you will need to store your
            ACL information somewhere. This necessitates the instantiation of a
            <code class="literal">DataSource</code> using Spring. The <code class="literal">DataSource</code> is then
            injected into a <code class="literal">JdbcMutableAclService</code> and
                <code class="literal">BasicLookupStrategy</code> instance. The latter provides
            high-performance ACL retrieval capabilities, and the former provides mutator
            capabilities. Refer to one of the samples that ship with Spring Security for an example
            configuration. You'll also need to populate the database with the four ACL-specific
            tables listed in the last section (refer to the ACL samples for the appropriate SQL
            statements).</p>
        <p>Once you've created the required schema and instantiated
                <code class="literal">JdbcMutableAclService</code>, you'll next need to ensure your domain
            model supports interoperability with the Spring Security ACL package. Hopefully
                <code class="literal">ObjectIdentityImpl</code> will prove sufficient, as it provides a large
            number of ways in which it can be used. Most people will have domain objects that
            contain a <code class="literal">public Serializable getId()</code> method. If the return type is
            long, or compatible with long (eg an int), you will find you need not give further
            consideration to <code class="literal">ObjectIdentity</code> issues. Many parts of the ACL module
            rely on long identifiers. If you're not using long (or an int, byte etc), there is a
            very good chance you'll need to reimplement a number of classes. We do not intend to
            support non-long identifiers in Spring Security's ACL module, as longs are already
            compatible with all database sequences, the most common identifier data type, and are of
            sufficient length to accommodate all common usage scenarios.</p>
        <p>The following fragment of code shows how to create an <code class="literal">Acl</code>, or
            modify an existing
            <code class="literal">Acl</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">// Prepare the information we'd like in our access control entry (ACE)
ObjectIdentity oi = new ObjectIdentityImpl(Foo.class, new Long(44));
Sid sid = new PrincipalSid("Samantha");
Permission p = BasePermission.ADMINISTRATION;

// Create or update the relevant ACL
MutableAcl acl = null;
try {
  acl = (MutableAcl) aclService.readAclById(oi);
} catch (NotFoundException nfe) {
  acl = aclService.createAcl(oi);
}

// Now grant some permissions via an access control entry (ACE)
acl.insertAce(acl.getEntries().length, p, sid, true);
aclService.updateAcl(acl);
</pre>
        <p>In the example above, we're retrieving the ACL associated with the "Foo" domain object
            with identifier number 44. We're then adding an ACE so that a principal named "Samantha"
            can "administer" the object. The code fragment is relatively self-explanatory, except
            the insertAce method. The first argument to the insertAce method is determining at what
            position in the Acl the new entry will be inserted. In the example above, we're just
            putting the new ACE at the end of the existing ACEs. The final argument is a boolean
            indicating whether the ACE is granting or denying. Most of the time it will be granting
            (true), but if it is denying (false), the permissions are effectively being blocked.</p>
        <p>Spring Security does not provide any special integration to automatically create,
            update or delete ACLs as part of your DAO or repository operations. Instead, you will
            need to write code like shown above for your individual domain objects. It's worth
            considering using AOP on your services layer to automatically integrate the ACL
            information with your services layer operations. We've found this quite an effective
            approach in the past.</p>
        <p>Once you've used the above techniques to store some ACL information in the database,
            the next step is to actually use the ACL information as part of authorization decision
            logic. You have a number of choices here. You could write your own
                <code class="interfacename">AccessDecisionVoter</code> or <code class="literal">AfterInvocationProvider</code>
            that respectively fires before or after a method invocation. Such classes would use
                <code class="literal">AclService</code> to retrieve the relevant ACL and then call
                <code class="literal">Acl.isGranted(Permission[] permission, Sid[] sids, boolean
                administrativeMode)</code> to decide whether permission is granted or denied.
            Alternately, you could use our <code class="literal">AclEntryVoter</code>,
                <code class="literal">AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider</code> or
                <code class="literal">AclEntryAfterInvocationCollectionFilteringProvider</code> classes. All
            of these classes provide a declarative-based approach to evaluating ACL information at
            runtime, freeing you from needing to write any code. Please refer to the sample
            applications to learn how to use these classes.</p>
